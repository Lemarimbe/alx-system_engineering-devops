# 0-current_working_directory.sh
This script is a simple Bash script that prints the absolute path name of the current working directory when executed. The script uses the pwd command to print the current working directory's absolute path name.

# Usage
To run the script, simply navigate to the directory where the 0-current_working_directory.sh file is located and execute the script by running the following command:

./0-current_working_directory.sh

This will print the absolute path name of the current working directory to the terminal.

#Example

Suppose the 0-current_working_directory.sh file is located in the following directory:


/home/user/projects/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics

To execute the script, navigate to the 0x00-shell_basics directory and run the following command:


./0-current_working_directory.sh

This will output the following to the terminal:


/home/user/projects/alx-system_engineering-devops/0x00-shell_basics


That's it! This is what the 0-current_working_directory.sh script does and how to use it.
